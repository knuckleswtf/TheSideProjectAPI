# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer {BEARER_TOKEN}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

You can retrieve your token by using the `users/auth` endpoint.
