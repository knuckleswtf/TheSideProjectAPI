The SideProject API is a sample API, built to demonstrate [Scribe's](http://scribe.knuckles.wtf) capabilities.

Like many side projects, it is itself an unfinished API, but hopefully it should be enough to convince you to try Scribe out.ðŸ˜‰ You can check out the source code [on GitHub](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/TheSideProjectAPI/).

<aside>As you scroll, you'll see code examples for working with the API in different programming languages in the dark area to the right (or as part of the content on mobile).
You can switch the language used with the tabs at the top right (or from the nav menu at the top left on mobile).</aside>
