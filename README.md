# The SideProject API

Sample (Laravel) API to demonstrate [Scribe's](http://scribe.knuckles.wtf) API documentation capabilities. See the docs at [demo.scribe.knuckles.wtf](http://demo.scribe.knuckles.wtf).


The docs are generated with `php artisan scribe:generate` into the docs/ folder, so that GitHub Pages can work with them. To visit the docs locally, simply open the `docs/index.html` file in your browser.
